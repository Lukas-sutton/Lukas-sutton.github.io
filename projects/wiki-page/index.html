            <b> Crown shyness </b> <i>(also canopy disengagement,<sup>1 </sup>
                 canopy shyness,<sup> [2] </sup> or inter-crown spacing <sup>[3]
                 </sup>)</i> is a phenomenon observed in some
            tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not
             touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>
                [4][5] </sup> The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of 
                the same species,but also occurs between trees of different 
                species.<sup>[6][7]</sup> There 
               exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive
                behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of
                 leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

                The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
                <sup>[6]</sup> The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific 
                literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup>
                 The variety of hypotheses and experimental
                 results might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across
                  different species, an example of convergent evolution.

                Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy
                 branches leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees:
                  trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide 
                  with each other during winds; the abrasions and collisions 
                  induce a crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral 
                  branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until 
                  disturbed by mechanical abrasion.[10] If the crowns are 
                  artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, 
                  they gradually fill the canopy gaps.[11] This explains 
                  instances of crown shyness between branches of the same 
                  organism. Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is
                   particularly seen in conditions conducive to this pruning,
                    including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and 
                    early succession forests where branches are flexible and l
                    imited in lateral movement.[6][12] According to this 
                    theory, variable flexibility in lateral branches greatly 
                    influences the degree of crown shyness.
