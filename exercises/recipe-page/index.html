                    2 teaspoons cornstarch
                </li>

                 <li>

                </li>

                <li>
                    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
                </li>

                 <li>
                    1 tablespoon matcha powder
                </li>

                <li>
                    2 tablespoons room temp water
                </li>

                </ul>

                <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        In a medium saucepan, whisk together the milk, cream, 
                        sugar, cornstarch, milk powder, and vanilla extract 
                        until smooth and fully dissolved.
                    </li>

                <li>
                    Place the pan over medium-low heat and cook, stirring often,
                     until it begins to gently bubble.
                    </li>

                 <li>
                    Continue cooking on low to medium-low heat for 45 minutes 
                    to 1 hour, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. 
                    The mixture should reduce and thicken to a creamy, jammy 
                    consistency that coats the back of a spoon.
                </li>

                <li>
                    While itâ€™s cooking, whisk the matcha powder with the water 
                    in a small bowl using a W and M motion until completely 
                    smooth and lump-free.
                </li>

                 <li>
                    Once the milk jam has thickened, remove the pan from heat.
                     Add the matcha mixture and whisk until fully combined 
                     and smooth.
                    </li>

                <li>
                    Pour the matcha milk jam into a clean jar and let it cool 
                    to room temperature. It will thicken slightly as 
                    it cools.
                </li>

                 <li>
                    Store in the refrigerator for up to one week. It continues 
                    to firm up the longer it sits in the fridge, so give it a 
                    stir before using if needed!
                </li>

                 </ol>
